#        RealmID must match the realmlist inside the realmd database
#
#    DataDir
#        Data directory setting.

#        Logs directory setting.
#        Important: Logs dir must exists, or all logs need to be disabled
#        Default: "" - no log directory prefix. if used log names aren't absolute paths
#                      then logs will be stored in the current directory of the running program.

#    WorldDatabaseInfo
#    CharacterDatabaseInfo
#        Database connection settings for the world server.
#        Default:

#                    hostname;port;username;password;database

#                        Named pipes: mySQL required adding "enable-named-pipe" to [mysqld] section my.ini
#                    .;/path/to/unix_socket;username;password;database - use Unix sockets at Unix/Linux
#                ---PGSQL---
#                    hostname;port;username;password;database
#                    .;/path/to/unix_socket/DIRECTORY or . for default path;username;password;database - use Unix sockets at Unix/Linux
#
#	LoginDatabaseConnections
#	WorldDatabaseConnections
#	CharacterDatabaseConnections
#		 Amount of connections to database which will be used for SELECT queries. Maximum 16 connections per database.
#		 Please, note, for data consistency only one connection for each database is used for transactions and async SELECTs.
#		 So formula to find out how many connections will be established: X = ¹_connections + 1
#		 Default: 1 connection for SELECT statements
#
#    MaxPingTime
#        Settings for maximum database-ping interval (minutes between pings)
#
#    WorldServerPort
#        Port on which the server will listen
#
#    BindIP
#        Bind World Server to IP/hostname
#        This option is useful for running multiple worldd/realmd instances
#        on different IP addresses using default ports.
#        DO NOT CHANGE THIS UNLESS YOU _REALLY_ KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
