Linux:

1. Building

	Because vmap_extractor depends on libmpq for reading mpq files, you will have
	to build libmpq prior to vmap_extractor. Therefore cd to dep/libmpq and execute:

	$ ./autogen.sh
	$ ./configure
	$ make

	After that, cd to contrib/vmap_extractor_v2/ and execute:

	$ cmake .
	$ make

	You should now have an executable file at vmapextract/vmapextractor

2. Extracting

	Use the created executable to extract model information. Change the data path if
	needed.

	$ vmapextract/vmapextractor -d /mnt/windows/games/wow/Data/

	Resulting files will be in ./Buildings

###########################
Windows:

1. Building

	Just build the solution in contrib\vmap_extractor_v2\win
	Resulting binaries will be in contrib\vmap_extractor_v2\bin\$(PlatformName)_$(ConfigurationName)

2. Extracting

	Use the created executable (from command prompt) to extract model information.
	It should find the data path for your client installation through the windows registry,
	but the data path can be specified with the -d option.

	Resulting files will be in .\Buildings
