== Welcome to MaNGOS ==

MaNGOS (the Massive Network Game Object Server) is an Open Source reference
implementation for a MMORPG server system. Please see the file COPYING for
license details.

For further information on the MaNGOS project, please visit our project web
site at <http://getmangos.com/>

Documentation on various development related topics can be found in the doc/
subdirectory, including Doxygen-generated API documentation.

The required SQL files for creating the database backend are included in the
sql/ subdirectory. In case you are upgrading from an older MaNGOS release,
make sure you as well take a look at the SQL files in the sql/updates/ sub-
directory.

In order to build and install MaNGOS under Windows, simply use the delivered
project files under win/. If you use a different system use CMake to generate
the appropriate build files for your system.
