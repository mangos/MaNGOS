[<img src="https://www.getmangos.eu/!assets_mangos/currentlogo.gif" width="96" valign="middle"/>](http://getmangos.eu)Welcome to the original MaNGOS emu project
<br>(sometimes called getMangos by external sites linking to us)
----

MaNGOS was formally announced as a public open source project around the 28th August 2005 by theLuda, he remained at the helm until December 2012 when he decided to retire from the emu scene. At this time he handed over the reins to Antz (Billy1arm on github etc.) who has run the project ever since.

During its history several splits occurred (all prior to December 2012) and from these the Trinity Core & Cmangos forks among many others were formed.

Due to legal disagreements, the website URL and icon has changed several times over its history. mangosproject.org, getmangos.com, getmangos.co.uk, its current home is getmangos.eu.

Over the years we have had a selection of Icons:

[<img src="https://www.getmangos.eu/!assets_mangos/oldlogo_variant.png" width="32" valign="middle"/>](http://getmangos.eu)
[<img src="https://www.getmangos.eu/!assets_mangos/oldlogo2.png" width="32" valign="middle"/>](http://getmangos.eu) The last one being a copyright violation of a chinese Tv channel !
<br>But have settled on the 
[<img src="https://www.getmangos.eu/!assets_mangos/currentlogo.gif" width="32" valign="middle"/>](http://getmangos.eu) family of icons designed by UnkleNuke which vary slightly by core/expansion (see the full set [HERE](mangosFamily.md)).

The original ideals and insistence that MaNGOS remained an open-source educational project continues today.
- To that end we are very beginner friendly, with many of the team available to help walk users through the initial setup/installation process.
- Something unique to mangos is that all junior devs are mentored by more experienced devs and are encouraged to talk through any issues they may have.

MaNGOS has a small, but extremely friendly and helpful community managed by MadMax and Antz. Any trolling or unpleasantness is swiftly dealt with !!
- Our discord/forum motto is "Be nice or Be somewhere else"

We welcome anyone who is interested in enjoying older versions of wow or contributing and helping out !

* [**Official MaNGOS Site**](https://getmangos.eu/)

We supports 5 WoW versions: Vanilla, TBC, WOTLK, CATA and MOP (although the CATA and MOP branches are in need of work) written in c++ in many different github repositories.

* [**Mangos Zero**](https://github.com/mangoszero/) - For Vanilla World of Warcraft
* [**Mangos One**](https://github.com/mangosone/) - For World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade
* [**Mangos Two**](https://github.com/mangostwo/) - For World of Warcraft: The Wrath of the Lich King
* [**Mangos Three**](https://github.com/mangosthree/) - For World of Warcraft: The Cataclysm
* [**Mangos Four**](https://github.com/mangosfour/) - For World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria
* [**Mangos Tools**](https://github.com/mangostools/) - For General MaNGOS Tools and Utilities

We also have a vb.Net based Emulator called MangosVB for Vanilla, TBC and WOTLK (originally called Spurious before merging under the MaNGOS banner).

* [**MangosVB0**](https://github.com/mangosvb/serverZero/) - For Vanilla World of Warcraft
* [**MangosVB1**](https://github.com/mangosvb/serverOne/) - For World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade
* [**MangosVB2**](https://github.com/mangosvb/serverTwo/) - For World of Warcraft: The Wrath of the Lich King

In addition we now also have a prototype C# project MangosSharp (aka Mangos#) using .Net 5, which is based on the work on mangosVB.

* [**MangosSharp**](https://github.com/MangosServer/MangosSharp/) - For Vanilla World of Warcraft

The overall plan is that all three sub-projects Mangos, MangosVB and Mangos# will use the same database across the cores.
