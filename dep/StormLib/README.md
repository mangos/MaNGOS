The StormLib library is a pack of modules, written in C++, which are able to
read and also to write files from/to the MPQ archives.

MPQ (MoPaQ) is an archive format developed by Blizzard Entertainment,
purposed for storing data files, images, sounds, music and videos for their
games.

*Notice*: this repository is meant to track the development of the original
[stormlib][1], developed by [Ladislav Zezula][2].

Usage
-----
This library is used inside of [mangos-zero][3] to access data inside of MPQ
archives included in the [World of Warcraft][4] game client.
