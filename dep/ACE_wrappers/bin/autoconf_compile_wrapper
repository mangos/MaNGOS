# Usually cron setups a really miserable enviroment, this script
# serves two purposes:
# 1. Setup a good enviroment for auto_compile.
# 2. Invoke auto_compile with the proper arguments for each site.
#
# The idea is to modify this script on a per-site basis and leave
# auto_compile unmodified.
#

# Setup a proper path, remember that cvs, make, perl5 and your
# compiler must be there.
